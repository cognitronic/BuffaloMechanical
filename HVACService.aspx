Sometimes we are referred to as a “boutique” service department due to our attention to customer needs and a unique understanding that our customers do not want problems.                           <br />
                                   Many of our customers are not onsite and rely on us to make sure the HVAC system are working correctly and reporting accurately the condition of their equipment. We keep accurate records of all our visits in case there is a need. When a repair is required we base our quotes on current and future needs as well as whether it is to be expensed or a capital purchase.                                 
                                </p>

                                   Properly maintained HVAC systems run longer with fewer problems! They also consume the less energy and help provide better indoor air quality. Buffalo’s offers different maintenance programs designed to match the facility. Whether it’s health care, retail, clean rooms, manufacturing or other unique applications we will customize our services to suit your application.
