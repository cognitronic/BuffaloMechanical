                                        <h6>Jason Buffalow<span class="person-title">President</span></h6>
                                        <p>Jason Buffalow was raised in the sheet metal /HVAC/refrigeration industry. His grandfather, Henry Buffalow, started Buffalow’s in 1948 as a commercial refrigeration company in Mt. View, CA. In the late 1960’s his father, Henry Buffalow, Jr. took over the family business and ran it for nearly twenty five years. Jason learned the basics of the HVAC industry and witnessed first hand how to run a successful company. In the mid 1990’s Jason began working for a few smaller mechanical contractors before starting Buffalo’s Mechanical, Inc. in 1995. 
                                            </p><p>
Over the last 18 years this company has experienced controlled growth from 4 residential/light commercial installers, to the medium sized commercial shop that it is today. Jason keeps his primary focus on taking good care of his customers, employees, vendors, and making business decisions based on what is right, not costs. Building and maintaining long term relationships is what Jason strives for. The future plan for Buffalo’s is simple…continue along the same path, building successful projects, enjoying who we work with, and appreciating who we work for.  </p>
                                        <p>
Jason lives and works in the small town of Ripon, CA. He is proud of his 18-year marriage to his wife Gina and loves being with their two children Joshua and Emily. Jason is passionate about wakeboarding, photography, traveling and anything in the sun.
